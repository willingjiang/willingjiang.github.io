## Courses

* Partial Differential Equations I (Instructor, Fall 2021) ShanghaiTech University
  * Motivation: Many natural phenomena have been successfully formulated as partial differential equations: common applications include Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics and population dynamics. 
  * Content: This course will be primarily focused on the theory of linear partial differential equations such as, the wave equation, the heat equation and the Laplace equation. We will also focus on variational principle, characteristic line method, Sturm-Liouville problems, boundary value problems, maximum principles, Fourier series and Fourier transforms, Green functions, harmonic functions, Sobolev space, some PDE problems from physics.
  * Purpose: The purpose of this class is to provide students with basic partial differential equations in mathematics and their qualitative properties that appear in physics and Chemistry, Biology, Economics and population dynamics. This class also helps students to understand Fourier Theory well. Moreover, students will learn many ideas for proving some inequalities in mathematics.
* Mathematical Analysis II Practice (Instructor, Spring 2021) ShanghaiTech University
* Mathematical Analysis I Practice (Instructor, Fall 2020) ShanghaiTech University
* Matrices (Instructor, Spring 2020) Penn State University
  * Catalog Description: Systems of linear equations; matrix
